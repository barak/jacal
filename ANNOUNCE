This message announces the availability of JACAL release jacal-1c7.

JACAL is an interactive symbolic mathematics program.  JACAL can
manipulate and simplify equations, scalars, vectors, and matrices of
single and multiple valued algebraic expressions containing numbers,
variables, radicals, and algebraic differential, and holonomic
functions.

JACAL is written in Scheme and works with Scheme implementations which
support the SLIB Scheme Library.  The SCM Scheme implementation
(written in C) is available with JACAL.  SCM runs on Amiga, Atari-ST,
MacOS, MS-DOS, OS/2, NOS/VE, Unicos, VMS, Windows, Unix and similar
systems.

JACAL is free software and part of the GNU project.  It is released
under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

Documentation and distributions in several formats are linked from
JACAL's home page:

Links to distributions of JACAL and related softwares are at the end

jacal-1c7 news:

Jacal now does integration of rational functions whose integrals
are rational functions possibly involving a radical involving the
integration variable.  The integration algorithm is documented in
<http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/ratint.pdf>

Details at
<http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/jacal/jacal/ChangeLog>

  * DOC/ratint.tex, anti-diff.scm (rat:integrate): Corrected
  algorithm.
  * jacal.texi (Calculus): Broadened domain of application and added
  examples.
  * anti-diff.scm (independent-of-var?): Ignore integration
  constants when checking result.
  (indef-integrate): Return novalue when integration fails.
  (rat:integrate): Debugged for rational expressions with single
  algebraic field extension.
  * anti-diff.scm (sqfr-splits): Fixed variable ordering bug.
  (indef-integrate): Normalize return value.
  (rat:integrate): Code cleanup.
  (rat:integrate): Long-division by extension var first.
  (indef-integrate): Use _$ as dummy extension var.
  * DOC/ratint.tex (section{Algebraic field extension}): Tracking
  anti-diff.scm.
  * anti-diff.scm (rat:integrate, indef-integrate): Nearly working
  with algebraic field extension.
  (poly:integrate): No longer needed.
  * ff.scm (ff:unorm): Fail gracefully when argument is number.
  * DOC/ratint.tex (section{Algebraic field extension}): Fixed
  coeff() argument order.
  (section{Rational Function Integration}): Expanded explanation.
  * anti-diff.scm (rat:integrate): Put all numerator factors into
  p_1(x).  Tighten bounds check for M vs. N.
  (indef-integrate): Workaround negated integration bug.
  * Makefile (w32install): Output to dist directory.
  * DOC/ratint.tex (section{Algebraic field extension}): Redevelop
  algorithm to handle algebraic field extensions.
  * anti-diff.scm (indef-integrate): Warn if derivative of integral
  does not equal original integrand.
  (rat:integrate): Reorganized along path to handling algebraic
  extensions.
  * t.math, test.math: Added high power integration test.
