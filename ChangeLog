Mon Apr 16 01:21:49 1990  Aubrey Jaffer  (jaffer at lammert)

	* ext (ext_clear-denoms):
	works for square roots.  subtle problem with determinant screws up
	higher order.

	* meta -> builtins :
	documentation strings entered for most functions.
	* poly (sylvester & bruno) :
	resultant matrix functions created.

Wed Apr 11 01:37:54 1990  Aubrey Jaffer  (jaffer at lammert)

	radicands now come out positive.

Thu Apr  5 01:02:04 1990  Aubrey Jaffer  (jaffer at lammert)

	* radicals, matrix, types (make-rat):
	created in types.  This eliminates almost all constructions:

	* cgol (all):
	all syntax tables now in one structure: cgol_grammar.

	* seval, syntax, cgol (seval, bunch->sexp, inprint, #\[):
	sexps now use vectors instead of '(bunch ...) to represent vectors.
	delimiters for end of expression (#\; #\$) now are read after the
	expression is read and dispatched in seval.  This should move to cgol.

Tue Mar 27 00:19:21 1990  Aubrey Jaffer  (jaffer at gerber)

	* poly, types, seval:
	leading coefficient of impls is now negative.  this means less

	simplified

Tue Mar 20 00:08:31 1990  Aubrey Jaffer  (jaffer at lammert)

	* poly.lisp (degree&lc):
	eliminated in favor of much simpler degree.  This sidesteps Common
	Lisp compiler problem.  It also means lc is not contructed unless
	it is needed.  Should speed things up.

	* scl.scm:
	read-file removed (was interfering with reader).  Many common lisp
	utility functions defined.

	* syntax.l:
	"|" eliminated from symbol names.  Scheme association lists now
