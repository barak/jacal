				JACAL

In December of 1987, in order to facilitate the design of constant
impedance electrical filters (diplexers), I wrote a symbolic circuit
analysis program.  It was written in LISP (2 weeks) and implemented
canonical rational expressions.  It worked directly with the small
signal Laplace Transform of currents, voltages, and impedances.  After
doing some reading about symbolic manipulation, I became fascinated
with the problem of canonical forms.  That interest produced JACAL.

JACAL is a symbolic mathematics system for the simplification and
manipulation of equations and single and multiple valued algebraic
expressions constructed of numbers, variables, radicals, and algebraic
functions, differential, and holonomic functions.  In addition,
vectors and matrices of the above objects are included.

JACAL is written in Scheme.  An implementation of Scheme conforming to
Revised^5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme and the IEEE P1178
specification is available with JACAL.  Scm is written in C and runs
under Amiga, Atari-ST, GNU/Linux, MacOS, MS-DOS, MS-Vista, MS-Windows,
OS/2, NOS/VE, Unicos, VMS, Unix and similar systems.
