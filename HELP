                              JACAL HELP

You are typing at Jacal's top level.  Typing "qed;" will exit Jacal to
Scheme.  If you are running in an interactive Scheme, you can reenter
your session by typing "(math)".

When you see the line "--more--" printed by Jacal, type <space>
followed by <return> (or <enter>) to see more of what is being
printed.  Type "q" or "Q" to stop the printing of the expression or
file.

There is a limited online help system.  Type "commands();" to see all
available commands.  Typing "describe(describe);" will give a short
explanation of describe.  Typing "example(describe);" will give an
example of the use of describe.  Not all commands have examples.

Jacal also has flags that can be set to control features of operation.
Typing "show all;" will list them.

When Jacal thinks that a sub-expression is missing from an input
expression, it will put a "?" in the place it expected the
sub-expression.  This "?" can be treated as a regular variable.  You
can use this to modify the expression (using Eliminate) so that you
don't have to retype the entire expression.
