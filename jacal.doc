DESCRIPTION
       JACAL is a symbolic  mathematics  system  for  the  simplification  and
       manipulation  of  equations  and  single  and multiple valued algebraic
       expressions constructed of numbers, variables, radicals, and  algebraic
       functions, differential, and holonomic functions.  In addition, vectors
       and matrices of the above objects are included.

OPTIONS
       The optional argument to the jacal script is the Scheme  implementation
       to  run.   Absent  the argument, it searches for implementations in the
       above order.
