1.2 Installation
================

The JACAL program is written in the Algorithmic Language "Scheme".  So
you must obtain and install a Scheme implementation in order to run it.
The installation procedures given here use the SCM Scheme
implementation.  If your system has a Scheme (or Guile) implementation
installed, then the `scm' steps are unnecessary.

  JACAL also requires the SLIB Portable Scheme library which is
available from `http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/~jaffer/SLIB'.                     |

 -- System: i386 Linux with Redhat Package Manager (rpm)
          wget http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/ftpdir/scm/scm-5e3-1.i386.rpm       |
          wget http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/ftpdir/scm/slib-3a4-1.noarch.rpm    |
          wget http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/ftpdir/scm/jacal-1b7-1.noarch.rpm   |
          rpm -U scm-5e3-1.i386.rpm slib-3a4-1.noarch.rpm jacal-1b7-1.noarch.rpm
          rm scm-5e3-1.i386.rpm slib-3a4-1.noarch.rpm jacal-1b7-1.noarch.rpm  |

     The command `jacal' will start an interactive session.

 -- System: Unix
 -- System: Linux
          wget http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/ftpdir/scm/scm5e3.zip               |
          wget http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/ftpdir/scm/slib3a4.zip              |
          wget http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/ftpdir/scm/jacal1b7.zip             |
          unzip -ao scm5e3.zip                                                |
          unzip -ao slib3a4.zip                                               |
          unzip -ao jacal1b7.zip                                              |
          (cd scm; make scm; make install)
          (cd jacal; make install)
          rm scm5e3.zip slib3a4.zip jacal1b7.zip                              |

     The command `jacal' will start an interactive session using ELK,
     MIT-Scheme, Gambit, UMB-Scheme, MzScheme, Guile, or SCM.

 -- System: Apple
     `http://www.io.com/~cobblers/scm/' has downloads and utilities for
     installing SCM and SLIB on Macintosh computers.

 -- System: Microsoft
     Download `http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/ftpdir/scm/scm.exe',
     `http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/ftpdir/scm/scm5e3.zip',                      |
     `http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/ftpdir/scm/slib3a4.zip', and                 |
     `http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/ftpdir/scm/jacal1b7.zip'.                    |

     Unzip each, creating the `scm', `slib', and `jacal' subdirectories.

     Create a batch script named `jacal.bat' to start Scheme and load
     `jacal/math.scm'.  If `scm.exe' and the subdirectories are
     installed in `c:\scm\', then `jacal.bat' would be:

          @c:\scm\scm -iql c:\scm\jacal\math -ie"(math)"

     Start a MS-DOS prompt and CD to the installation directory.  Type
     `jacal'.  If jacal prints:

          JACAL version 1b7, Copyright 1989-2002 Aubrey Jaffer                |
          JACAL comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `(terms)'.
          This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
          under certain conditions; type `(terms)' for details.
          ;;; Type (math) to begin.

     then it is installed successfully.  Drag `jacal.bat' to the desktop
     if desired.  scm5e3.zip, slib3a4.zip, jacal1b7.zip can be deleted.       |

Compiling Jacal
---------------

For Scheme implementations with compilers, it is worthwhile to compile
SLIB files, and the JACAL files `types.scm' and `poly.scm'.


File: jacal.info,  Node: Running Jacal,  Next: Release Notes,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Overview

1.3 Running Jacal
=================

If you successfully executed one of the installations of the previous
section, then typing `jacal' or clicking an icon will begin an
interactive session.

  To manually start jacal, start your Scheme implementation with SLIB.
This may involve setting up that implementation's initialization file or
LOADing a `.init' file from the `slib' directory.  Then type:

     (slib:load "/usr/local/lib/jacal/math")

where `/usr/local/lib/jacal/' is a path to the JACAL directory.  JACAL
should then print:

     JACAL version 1b7, Copyright 1989-1999, 2002 Aubrey Jaffer               |
     JACAL comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `(terms)'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `(terms)' for details.
     ;;; Type (math) to begin.

Do as it says:

     (math)
     =>
     type qed; to return to scheme, type help; for help.
     e0 :

And you are ready to try the commands described in the rest of the
manual.

Demonstrating Jacal
-------------------

There are several demonstration files in the `jacal' directory.  To
run, use the batch command *Note batch: Miscellaneous.

`demo'
     Demonstrates a variety of JACAL features.

`test.math'
     Tests each operator.

`rw.math'
     Demonstrates tensors and The Robertson-Walker Cosmology Model.

Recovery from Errors
--------------------

As JACAL is a complicated program there are bugs which will occasionally
cause the program to stop with some sort of error reported by the
underlying Scheme system.  In interactive implementations (such as SCM)
you can usually continue your session by typing `(math)'.  The
expression which was input to JACAL just before the error will be lost
but you should be able to otherwise continue with your session.

Stopping Jacal
--------------

The command `quit();' will end your JACAL session.

  With non-interactive Scheme implementations the JACAL command
`qed();' or typing the end-of-file character (<C-z> on MS-DOS and VMS,
<C-d> on others) will end your JACAL session.

  The command `qed();' will return to the interactive Scheme session.
Typing `(math)' will return to the JACAL session.

  From the interactive Scheme session `(exit)' or possibly an
end-of-file character will terminate the session.

1.4 Release Notes
=================

With the standard input grammar, the precedence of `-' as a prefix
behaves strangely.  `a^-b*c' becomes `a^(-b*c)' while `a^b*c=> (a^b)*c'.

  Using `divide' to divide a polynomial by an integer does not work.

  The command `example' executes the example it gives.  This can lead
to unpredictable results if the variables and constants in the example
have already been given values by the user.

  The function `minor' should be modified to accept lists for ROW and
COL.

  Resultant might be modified to compute the resultant of a system of
polynomials with respect to a list of variables.

Conventions
-----------

Things that are labeled as Operators can occur in expressions output by
Jacal.  Things that are labeled as Commands act upon their arguments and
do not generally occur in expressions output by Jacal.  Things that are
labeled as flags are `set' to control aspects of the Jacal environment.

  The examples throughout this text were produced using `SCM'.

  Jacal has several grammers it understands.  The `standard' grammar is
used in this manual.  It is like simple `TeX' grammar and algol family
computer languages.

  Identifier names are case sensitive and can be any number of
characters long.

2.1 Algebraic Operators
=======================

 -- Operator: + augend addend
     Addition of scalar quantities or componentwise addition of bunches
     is accomplished by means of the infix operator `+'. For example,

          e2 : a:[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 7]];

              [1  3  5]
          e2: [       ]
              [2  4  7]

          e3 : b:[2, 4];

          e3: [2, 4]

          e4 : a + b;

              [3  5  7 ]
          e4: [        ]
              [6  8  11]

          e5 : 3 + 2;

          e5: 5

          e6 : c + b;

          e6: [2 + c, 4 + c]

          e7 : e1 + e5;

                   2   2
          e7: 5 + (8 a + 12 a ) b

 -- Operator: - minuend subtrahend
 -- Operator: - subtrahend
     The symbol `-' is used to denote either the binary infix operator
     subtraction or the unary minus.

          e1 : -[1,2,3];

          e1: [-1, -2, -3]

          e2 : 3-7;

          e2: -4

 -- Operator: +/- minuend subtrahend
 -- Operator: -/+ minuend subtrahend
 -- Operator: +/- augend
 -- Operator: -/+ augend
     Jacal allows the use of `+/-' and `-/+' as ambiguous signs (unary
     plus-or-minus, unary minus-or-plus) and as ambiguous infix
     operators (binary plus-or-minus, binary minus-or-plus). The value
     `+/-' is also represented by the constant `%sqrt1', while `-/+' is
     represented by `-%sqrt1'.

          e7 : u:+/-3;

          e7: 3 %sqrt1

          e8 : u^2;

          e8: 9

          e9 : +/-(u);

          e9: 3

          e10 : u-/+3;

          e10: b-/+(3 %sqrt1, 3)

 -- Operator: * multiplicand1 multiplicand2
     Multiplication of scalar expressions such as numbers, polynomials,
     rational functions and algebraic functions is denoted by the infix
     operator `*'.  For example,

          e1 : (2 + 3 * a) * 4 * a * b^2;

                         2   2
          e1: (8 a + 12 a ) b

     One can also use `*' as an infix operator on bunches.  In that
     case, it operates componentwise, in an appropriate sense.  If the
     bunches are square matrices, the operator `*' multiplies
     corresponding entries of the two factors.  It does not perform
     matrix multiplication.  To multiply matrices one instead uses the
     operator `.' (i.e., a period).  More generally, any binary scalar
     operator other than `^' can be used on bunches and acts
     componentwise.

 -- Operator: / dividend divisor
     The symbol for division in Jacal is `/'.  For example, the value
     returned by `6 / 2' is `3'.

          e3 : (x^2 - y^2) / (x - y);

          e3: x + y

 -- Operator: ^ expression exponent
     The infix operator `^' is used for exponentiation of scalar
     quantitites or for componentwise exponentiation of bunches.  For
     example, `2^5' returns 32.  Unlike the other scalar infix
     operators, one cannot use `^' for component-wise operations on
     bunches.  Furthermore, one should not try to use `^' to raise a
     square matrix to a power.  Instead, one should use `^^'.

          e7 : (1+x)^4;

                           2      3    4
          e7: 1 + 4 x + 6 x  + 4 x  + x

 -- Operator: = expression1 expression2
     In Jacal, the equals sign `=' is _not_ used for conditionals and
     it is _not_ used for assignments.  To assign one value to another,
     use either `:' or `:='.  The operator `=' merely returns a value
     of the form `0 = EXPRESSION'.  The value returned by `a = b', for
     example is `0 = a - b'.

          e6 : 1=2;

          e6: 0 = -1

 -- Operator: || Z1 Z2
     The infix operator `||' is from electrical engineering and
     represents the effective impedance of the parallel connection of

2.2 Algebraic Commands
======================

 -- Command: eliminate [eqn_1 eqn_2 ...] [var_1 var_2 ...]
     Here EQN_I is an equation for I = 1 ... N and where VAR_J is a
     variable for J = 1 ... M.  `eliminate' returns a list of equations
     obtained by eliminating the variables VAR_1, ..., VAR_M from the
     equations EQN_1, ..., EQN_N.

          e39 : eliminate([x^2+y=0,x^3+y=0],[x]);

                          2
          e39: 0 = - y - y

          e40 : eliminate([x+y+z=3,x^2+y^2+z^2=3,x^3+y^3+z^3=3],[x,y]);

          e40: 0 = 1 - z

 -- Command: suchthat var eqn
     The equation EQN must contain an occurence of variable VAR.
     `suchthat' returns an expression for all complex values of VAR
     satisfying EQN.  `suchthat' is useful for extracting an expression
     from an equation.

          e0 : a*x+b*y+c = 0;

          e0: 0 = c + a x + b y

          e1 : suchthat(x, e0);

              - c - b y
          e1: ---------
                  a

 -- Command: suchthat var exp
     If an expression rather than an equation is given to `suchthat', it
     is as though the equation `EXP=0' was given.

          e2 : suchthat(x, e0);

              - c - b y
          e2: ---------
                  a

 -- Operator: | var exp_or_eqn
     An alternative infix notation is also available for `suchthat'.

     When used in combination with the `{ }' notation for `or', the set
     notation used by some textbooks results.

     If VAR in EQN has multiple roots, a named "field extension" will
     be introduced to represent any one of those roots.  When multiple
     values are returned, the result (in `disp2d' and `standard'
     grammars) is wrapped with `{ }'.

          e3 : x | a*x^2 + b*x + c;

                                         2
          ext3: {:@ | 0 = c + b :@ + a :@ }
          e3: ext3

          e4 : e3 ^ 2;

              - c - b ext3
          e4: ------------
                   a

 -- Command: extrule extsym
     Returns the rule defining named field extension EXTSYM.

          e5 : extrule(ext3);

                                     2
          e5: 0 = c + b ext3 + a ext3

 -- Command: or expr_1 ...
 -- Command: or eqn_1 ...
     The function `or' takes as inputs one or more equations or values.
     If the inputs are equations, then `or' returns an equation which
     is equivalent to the assertion that at least one of the input
     equations holds. If the inputs to `or' are values instead of two
     equations, then the function `or' returns a multiple value. If the
     inputs to `or' consist of both equations and values, then `or'
     will return the multiple values.

          e1 : or(x=2,y=3);

          e1: 0 = -6 + 3 x + (2 - x) y

          e2 : or(2,3);

                                      2
          e2: {:@ | 0 = -6 + 5 :@ - :@ }

          e3 : e2^2;

                                        2
          e3: {:@ | 0 = -36 + 13 :@ - :@ }

          e4 : or(x=2,17);

          e4: 17

     `{EQN, ... }' can be used as an alternate syntax for `or':

          e5 : {+1, -1};

                               2
          e5: {:@ | 0 = -1 + :@ }

2.4 Polynomials
===============

 -- Operator: degree poly var
     Returns the degree of polynomial or equation POLY in variable VAR.

 -- Operator: degree poly
     Returns the total-degree, the degree of its highest degree
     monomial, of polynomial or equation POLY.

          e26 : degree(a*x*x + b*y*x + c*y*y + d*x + e*y + f, y);

          e26: 2

          e27 : degree(a*x*x + b*y*x + c*y*y + d*x + e*y + f);

          e27: 3

 -- Operator: coeff poly var
 -- Operator: coeff poly var deg
 -- Operator: coeffs poly var
     The command `coeff' is used to determine the coefficient of a
     certain power of a variable in a given polynomial. Here POLY is a
     polynomial and VAR is a variable. If the optional third argument
     is omitted, then Jacal returns the coefficient of the variable VAR
     in POLY. Otherwise it returns the coefficient of VAR^DEG in POLY.
     The function `coeffs' returns a list of all of the coefficients.
     For example,

          e14 : coeff((x + 2)^4, x, 3);

          e14: 8

          e15 : (x + 2)^4;

                               2      3    4
          e15: 16 + 32 x + 24 x  + 8 x  + x

          e16 : coeff((x + 2)^4, x);

          e16: 32

          e18 : coeffs((x + 2)^4, x);

          e18: [16, 32, 24, 8, 1]

 -- Operator: poly var vect
 -- Operator: poly var coeff1 ...
     The function `poly' provides an inverse to the function `coeffs',
     allowing one to recover a polynomial from its vector or list of
     coefficients.

          e15 : poly(y, [16, 32, 24, 8, 1]);

                               2      3    4
          e15: 16 + 32 y + 24 y  + 8 y  + y

          e16 : poly(y, 16, 32, 24, 8, 1);

                               2      3    4
          e16: 16 + 32 y + 24 y  + 8 y  + y

 -- Operator: poly eqn
     The function `poly' returns the expression equal to 0 in equation
     EQN.  Be aware that the sign and scaling of the returned
     polynomial will not necessarily match those in the equation
     creating EQN.

          e17 : 2*a = 4*c;

          e17: 0 = - a + 2 c

          e18 : poly(e17);

          e18: - a + 2 c

 -- Operator: content poly var
     Returns a list of content and primitive part of a polynomial with
     respect to the variable.  The content is the GCD of the
     coefficients of the polynomial in the variable.  The primitive
     part is POLY divided by the content.

          e24 : content(2*x*y+4*x^2*y^2,y);

                               2
          e24: [2 x, y + 2 x y ]

 -- Operator: divide dividend divisor var
 -- Operator: divide dividend divisor
     The command `divide' treats DIVIDENT and DIVISOR as polynomials in
     the variable VAR and returns a pair `[QUOTIENT, REMAINDER]' such
     that `DIVIDEND = DIVISOR * QUOTIENT + REMAINDER'. If the third
     argument VAR is omitted Jacal will choose a variable on its own
     with respect to which it will do the division. In particular, of
     DIVIDEND and DIVISOR are both numerical, one can safely omit the
     third argument.

          e5 : divide(x^2+y^2,x-7*y^2,x);

                      2    2       4

          e14 : divide(x^2+y^2+z^2,x+y+z,y);

                                 2              2
          e14: [- x + y - z, 2 x  + 2 x z + 2 z ]

 -- Command: mod poly1 eqn var
 -- Command: mod poly1 poly2 var

     POLY2 is univariate, the third argument is not needed.

 -- Command: mod poly1 n
     Returns POLY1 with all the coefficients taken modulo N.

 -- Command: mod poly1
     Returns POLY1 with all the coefficients taken modulo the current
     modulus.

     If the modulus (N or the current modulus) is negative, then the
     results use symmetric representation.

          e23: 1

          e24 : mod(x^4+4,x^2=2,x);

          e24: 8

 -- Command: gcd poly_1 poly_2
     The Jacal function `gcd' takes as arguments two polynomials with
     integer coefficients and returns a greatest common divisor of the
     two polynomials. This includes the case where the polynomials are
     integers.

          e1 : gcd(x^4-y^4,x^6+y^6);

               2    2

2.5 Factoring
=============

 -- Command: factor int
     The Jacal command `factor' takes as input an integer and returns a
     list of the prime numbers that divide it, each occurring with the
     appropriate multiplicity in the list. If the number is negative,
     the list will begin with -1.

     The results of the `factor' command are shown in a special
     "factored" format, which appears as the product of the factors.

          e0 : factor(120);

               3
          e0: 2  3 5

          e1 : factor(-120);

The rest of this section documents commands from the factoring package.
To use this package, execute the following command from the JACAL
prompt:

  `require("ff");'

Several of these commands return a matrix.  The first column contains
the factors and the second column contains the corresponding exponent.

 -- Command: sff poly
     Given a primitive univariate polynomial POLY, calculate the square
     free factorisation of POLY. A "primitive" polynomial is one with
     no factors (other than units) common to all its coefficients.

 -- Command: ffsff poly p
 -- Command: ffsff poly p m
     Given a monic polynomial POLY, a prime P, and a positive integer
     M, calculate the square free factorisation of POLY in GF(p^m)[x].
     If M is not supplied, `1' is assumed.

          e0 : ffsff(x^5+x^3+1, 53);

              [                2    3   ]
              [16 - 22 x + 26 x  + x   1]
          e0: [                         ]
              [       -13 + x          2]

 -- Command: berl poly n
     Given a square-free univariate polynomial POLY and an integer
     power of a prime, Q, returns (as a bunch) the irreducible factors
     of POLY.

          e2 : berl(x^5+x^3+2, 53);

                                  2               2
          e2: [1 + x, 5 - 26 x + x , 11 + 25 x + x ]

 -- Command: parfrac polyratio
     Returns the partial fraction expansion of a rational univariate
     polynomial POLYRATIO.  The denominator of POLYRATIO must be square
     free.  This code is still being developed.

3.1 Differential Operator
=========================

 -- Operator: differential expr
 -- Operator: ' expr
     The Jacal command `differential' computes the derivative of the
     expression EXPR with respect to a generic derivation. It is
     generic in the sense that nothing is assumed about its effect on
     the individual variables. The derivation is denoted by a right
     quote.

          e6 : differential(x^2+y^3);

                          2
          e6: 2 x x' + 3 y  y'

          e7 : (x^2+y^3)';

                          2
          e7: 2 x x' + 3 y  y'

3.2 Derivative Commands
=======================

 -- Command: diff expr var1 ...
     The Jacal command `diff' computes the derivative of the expression
     EXPR with respect to VAR1, ....

          e6 : diff(x^2+y^3,y);

                 2
          e6: 3 y

 -- Command: partial expr var1 ...
     The Jacal command `partial' computes the partial derivative of the
     expression EXPR with respect to VAR1, ....

          e6 : partial(x^2+@1^3,1);

                  2
          e6: 3 @1

 -- Command: PolyDiff poly var1 ...
     The Jacal command `PolyDiff' computes the derivative of the
     expression POLY with respect to VAR1, ....  It is faster than
     `diff' but POLY must be a polynomial.

4 Matrices and Tensors
**********************

In JACAL, a matrix is just a `bunch' of equal length `bunch's, and this
is the structure that the matrix operations currently supported by
JACAL (ncmult(), ^^, transpose(), etc.) expect.

4.1 Generating Matrices
=======================

 -- Operator: bunch elt_1 elt_2 ...
     `[ELT_1, ELT_2, ...]'

     To collect any number of Jacal objects into a bunch, simply
     enclose them in square brackets. For example, to make the bunch
     whose elements are `1', `2', `4', type `[1, 2, 4]'. One can also
     nest bunches, for example, `[1, [[1, 3], [2, 5]], [1, 4]]'.  Note
     however that the bunch whose only element is `[1, 2, 3]' is `[1 2
     3]'.  It is importance to notice that one has commas and the other
     doesn't.

          e3 : a:bunch(1, 2, 3);

          e3: [1, 2, 3]

          e4 : b:[a];

          e4: [1  2  3]

          e5 : c:[b];

          e5: [[1, 2, 3]]

          e6 : [[[1, 2, 3]]];

          e6: [[1, 2, 3]]

 -- Operator: flatten bnch
     Removes bunch nesting from BNCH, returning a single bunch of the
     constituent expressions and equations.

          e0 : flatten([a, [b, [c, d]], [5]]);

          e0: [a, b, c, d, 5]

 -- Command: ident n
     The command `ident' takes as argument a positive integer N and
     returns an NxN identity matrix. This is sometimes more convenient
     than obtaining this same matrix using the command `scalarmatrix'.

          e6 : ident(4);

              [1  0  0  0]
              [          ]
              [0  1  0  0]
          e6: [          ]
              [0  0  1  0]
              [          ]
              [0  0  0  1]

 -- Command: scalarmatrix size entry
     The command `scalarmatrix' takes as inputs a positive integer SIZE
     and an algebraic expression ENTRY and returns an `N * N' diagonal
     matrix whose diagonal entries are all equal to ENTRY, where `N =
     SIZE'.

          e1 : scalarmatrix(3, 6);

              [6  0  0]
              [       ]
          e1: [0  6  0]
              [       ]
              [0  0  6]

 -- Command: diagmatrix list
     The Jacal command `diagmatrix' takes as input a list of objects and
     returns the diagonal matrix having those objects as diagonal
     entries. In case one wants all of the diagonal entries to be
     equal, it is more convenient to use the command `scalarmatrix'.

          e3 : diagmatrix(12,3,a,s^2);

              [12  0  0  0 ]
              [            ]
              [0   3  0  0 ]
          e3: [            ]
              [0   0  a  0 ]
              [            ]
              [0   0  0   2]
              [          s ]

          e4 : diagmatrix([1,2],2);

              [[1, 2]  0]
          e4: [         ]
              [  0     2]

 -- Command: sylvester poly_1 poly_2 var
     Here, POLY_1 and POLY_2 are polynomials and VAR is a variable.
     The function `sylvester' returns the matrix introduced by
     Sylvester (`A Method of Determining By Mere Inspection the
     Derivatives from Two Equations of Any Degree, Phil.Mag. `16' (1840)
     pp. 132-135, Mathematical Papers, vol. I, pp. 54-57') for
     computing the resultant of the two polynomials POLY_1 and POLY_2
     with respect to the variable VAR. If one wants to compute the
     resultant itself, one can simply use the command `resultant' with
     the same syntax.

          e5 : sylvester(a0 + a1*x + a2*x^2 + a3*x^3, b0 + b1*x + b2*x^2, x);

              [a3  a2  a1  a0  0 ]
              [                  ]
              [0   a3  a2  a1  a0]
              [                  ]
          e5: [b2  b1  b0  0   0 ]
              [                  ]
              [0   b2  b1  b0  0 ]
              [                  ]
              [0   0   b2  b1  b0]

 -- Command: genmatrix function rows cols
     The function `genmatrix' takes as arguments a FUNCTION of two
     variables and two positive integers, ROWS and COLS. It returns a
     matrix with the indicated numbers of rows and columns in which the
     $(i,j)$th entry is obtained by evaluating FUNCTION at $(i,j)$. The
     function may be defined in any of the ways available in Jacal, i.e
     previously by an explicit algebraic definition, by an explicit
     lambda expression or by an implicit lambda expression.

          e4 : @1^2+@2^2;

                                 2      2
          e4: lambda([@1, @2], @1  + @2 )

          e5 : genmatrix(e4,3,5);

              [2   5   10  17  26]
              [                  ]
          e5: [5   8   13  20  29]
              [                  ]

4.2 Matrix Parts
================

 -- Command: row matrix i
     The command `row' returns the Ith row of the matrix MATRIX, where
     `i = INT'.  If INT is larger than the number of rows of MATRIX,
     then Jacal prints an error message.  The corresponding command for
     columns of a matrix is `col'.

          e3 : u:[[1, 2, 3], [1, 5, 3]];

              [1  2  3]
          e3: [       ]
              [1  5  3]

          e4 : row(u, 2);

          e4: [1, 5, 3]

 -- Command: col matrix integer
     The command `col' is used to extract a column of a matrix. Here,
     MATRIX is a matrix and INTEGER is a positive integer. If that
     integer exceeds the number of columns, an error message such as

          ERROR: list-ref: Wrong type in arg1 ()

     appears. Here is an example of correct use of the command `col':

          e19 : a:[[1,2,4],[2,5,6]];

               [1  2  4]
          e19: [       ]
               [2  5  6]

          e20 : col(a,2);

               [2]
          e20: [ ]
               [5]

 -- Command: minor matrix i j
     The command `minor' returns the submatrix of MATRIX obtained by
     deleting the Ith row and the Jth column.

          e21 : b:[[1,2,3],[3,1,5],[5,2,7]];

               [1  2  3]
               [       ]
          e21: [3  1  5]
               [       ]
               [5  2  7]

          e22 : minor(b,3,1);

               [2  3]
          e22: [    ]
               [1  5]

 -- Command: cofactor matrix i j
     The command `cofactor' returns the determinant of the I, J `minor'
     of MATRIX.

 -- Command: rapply bunch int_1 int_2 ...
     The function `rapply' is used to access elements of bunches.  It
     can also access elements nested at lower levels in a bunch.  In
     particular, it can also access matrix elements.  In the above
     syntax, BUNCH is the bunch whose parts one wishes to access, and N,
     INT_1, INT_2, ..., INT_N are positive integers.  It returns the
     INT_N-th element of the INT_{N-1}-th element of ... of the
     INT_2-th element of the INT_1-th element of BUNCH.  One can have
     `n = 0'.  In that case, `rapply' simply returns the bunch.

          e2 : rapply([[1,2,3],[1,4,6],3],2,3);

          e2: 6

          e6 : rapply([a,b],2);

          e6: b

          e7 : rapply([a,b]);

          e7: [a, b]

              [26  20  46]

 -- Command: ^^ matrix exponent
     The infix operator `^^' is used for raising a square matrix to an
     integral power.

          e8 : a:[[1, 0], [-1, 1]];

              [1   0]

 -- Command: dotproduct vector_1 vector_2
     The Jacal function `dotproduct' returns the dot product of two row
     vectors of the same length. It will also give the dot product of
     two matrices of the same size by computing the sum of the dot
     products of the corresponding rows or, what is the same, the trace
     of one matrix times the transpose of the other one.

          e28 : a:[1,2,3]; b:[3,1,5];

          e30 : dotproduct(a,b);

          e30: 20

 -- Command: crossproduct vector_1 vector_2
     The Jacal command `crossproduct' computes the cross product of two
     vectors.  By definition, the two vectors must each have three
     components.

          e24: [2 x, y + 2 x y ]

          e25 : crossproduct([1,2,3],[4,2,5]);

          e25: [4, 7, -6]

 -- Command: determinant matrix
     The Jacal command `determinant' computes the determinant of a
     square matrix.  Attempting to take the determinant of a non-square
     matrix will produce an error message.

          e1 : a:[[1,2],[6,7]];

              [1  2]
          e1: [    ]
              [6  7]

          e2 : determinant(a);

          e2: -5

 -- Command: transpose matrix
     Computes the transpose of `(MATRIX)'.

4.4 Tensors
===========

The `tensors' supported by JACAL are an extension of the matrix
structure (i.e., a bunch of bunches of bunches ...) with the added
stipulation that all `dimensions' of the tensor be the same length
(e.g., 4x4x4).  The number of dimensions (indices) in a tensor is its
rank: A scalar is a tensor of rank 0; a vector is a rank 1 tensor; a
matrix has rank 2; and so on.

  Further, just as matrix binary operations place restrictions on the
matrices involved (e.g., the row/column length requirement for matrix
multiplication), the tensor binary operations require that the
dimensions of each tensor be of the same length.  For example, you
could not multiply a 3x3 tensor and a 4x4x4 tensor.

  JACAL's tensors do not support the construct of contravariant and
covariant indices.  Users must keep track of this information
themselves, and perform the necessary operations with an appropriate
metric so that the "index gymnastics" is performed correctly.

  Before using any of JACAL's tensor operations, execute the following
command from the JACAL prompt:

  require("tensor");

  This loads the file `tensor.scm' into JACAL, and makes the tensor
operations available for use.

  JACAL currently supports four tensor operations: `tmult', `contract',
`indexshift', and `indexswap'.  Each of these is described in detail
below.

4.5 Tensor Multiplication
=========================

 -- Command: tmult matrix_1 matrix_2 index_1 index_2
     `tmult' takes a minimum of two arguments which are the tensors on
     which the multiplication operation is to be performed.

     With no additional arguments, `tmult' will produce the outer
     product of the two input tensors.  The rank of the resulting
     tensor is the sum of the inputs' ranks, and the components of the
     result are formed from the pair-wise products of components of the
     inputs.  For example, for the input tensors `x[a,b]' and `y[c]'
          z:tmult(x,y);=> z[a,b,c] = x[a,b]*y[c]

     With an additional argument, `tmult' will produce the inner product
     of the two tensors on the specified index.  For example, given
     `x[i,j]' and `y[k,l,m]'
          z:tmult(x,y,3);
          =>
                                  length
                                  -----
                                  \
                       z[a,b,c] =  >   x[a,q] * y[b,c,q]
                                  /
                                  -----
                                  q = 1

     Note that in this case X only has 2 indices.  All of JACAL's tensor
     operations modify index inputs to be between 1 and the rank of the
     tensor.  Thus, in this example, the 3 is modified to 2 in the case
     of X.  As another example, with `x[i,j,k]' and `y[l,m,n]'
          z:tmult(x,y,2);
          =>
                                    length
                                    -----
                                    \
                       z[a,b,c,d] =  >   x[a,q,b] * y[c,q,d]
                                    /
                                    -----
                                    q = 1

     With four arguments, `tmult' produces an inner product of the two
     tensors on the specified indices.  For example, for `x[i,j]' and
     `y[k,l,m]'
          z:tmult(x,y,1,3);
          =>
                                  length
                                  -----
                                  \
                       z[a,b,c] =  >   x[q,a] * y[b,c,q]
                                  /
                                  -----
                                  q = 1

     Note that matrix multiplication is the special case of an inner
     product (of two "two dimensional matrices") on the second and
     first indices, respectively: `tmult(x,y,2,1) == ncmult(x,y)'

     Finally, tmult handles the case of a scalar times a tensor, in
     which case each component of the tensor is multiplied by the
     scalar.

4.6 Tensor contraction
======================

 -- Command: contract matrix index1 ...
     The contraction operation produces a tensor of rank two less than
     a given tensor.  It does this by performing a summation over two
     of the indices of the given tensor, as clarified in the examples
     below.

     `contract' takes at least one argument which is the tensor on
     which the contraction operation is to be performed.  One or two
     additional arguments may be provided to specify the indices to be
     used in the summation.  If no additional arguments are provided,
     the summation is performed over the first and second indices.
     With one additional argument, the summation is over the specified
     index and the one following it (e.g., if 3 is specified, the third
     and fourth indices are used).  With two additional arguments, the
     summation is performed over the indices specified.  The actual
     indices used will be constrained to be between 1 and the rank of
     the tensor.

     Examples:

     1) For a square matrix (tensor of rank 2), `contract' returns a
     scalar that is the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix.

     2) Given `x[i,j,k,l]', the command
          y:contract(x,2,4);
     produces:
                                  length
                                  -----
                                  \
                         y[a,b] =  >   x[a,q,b,q]
                                  /
                                  -----
                                  q = 1

     Special cases:  If `contract' is given a scalar (rank 0 tensor) as
     input, it just returns the scalar.  For a vector (tensor of rank
     1), `contract' returns a scalar that is the sum of the elements of
     the vector.

4.7 Shifting of Tensor Indices
==============================

 -- Command: indexshift matrix index1 ...
     `indexshift' rearranges the indices of a tensor.  It is one of two
     generalizations of the matrix transpose operation (cf.
     `indexswap').

     `indexshift' takes at least one argument which is the tensor on
     which the index shifting is to be performed.  One or two
     additional arguments may be provided to specify the index and the
     position to which it is to be shifted.  If no additional arguments
     are provided, the first index of the tensor is shifted to the
     second position (equivalent the matrix transpose operation).  If
     one additional argument is provided, it specifies the index to be
     shifted, and that index will be shifted "to the right" one position
     (e.g., if 3 is specified, the third index will be shifted to the
     forth position).  If two additional arguments are provided, the
     first specifies the index and the second specifies the position to
     which it is to be shifted.  The actual index shifted and its
     shifted position will be constrained to be between 1 and the rank
     of the tensor.

     For example, given `x[a,b,c,d]', the command
     `y:indexshift(x,1,3);' produces a tensor Y such that `y[a,b,c,d]
     == x[b,c,a,d]'.  In this example, the element that was in position
     `[a,b,c,d]' in X will be in position `[b,c,a,d]' in Y.

     Special cases:  If `indexshift' is given a scalar (rank 0 tensor)
     as input, it just returns the scalar.  For a vector (tensor of
     rank 1), `indexshift' transposes the 1-by-n matrix (row vector) to
     an n-by-1 matrix (column vector).

4.8 Swapping of Tensor Indices
==============================

 -- Command: indexswap tensor ...
     `indexswap' rearranges the indices of a tensor.  It is one of two
     generalizations of the matrix transpose operation (cf.
     `indexshift').

     `indexswap' takes at least one argument which is the tensor on
     which index swapping is to be performed.  One or two additional
     arguments may be provided to specify the indices to be swapped.
     If no additional arguments are provided, the first and second
     indices of the tensor are swapped (equivalent the matrix transpose
     operation).   With one additional argument, the specified index is
     swapped with the one following it (e.g., if 2 is specified, the
     second and third indices will be swapped).  If two additional
     arguments are provided, they specify the indices to be swapped.
     The actual indices used will be constrained to be between 1 and
     the rank of the tensor.

     For example, given x[a,b,c,d], the command `y:indexswap(x,2,4);'
     produces a tensor Y such that y[a,b,c,d] = x[a,d,c,b].  In this
     example, the element that was in position [a,b,c,d] in X will be
     in position [a,d,c,b] in Y.

     Special cases:  If `indexswap' is given a scalar (rank 0 tensor)
     as input, it just returns the scalar.  For a vector (tensor of
     rank 1), `indexswap' transposes the 1-by-n matrix (row vector) to
     an n-by-1 matrix (column vector).

5 Lambda Calculus
*****************

5.1 Create a lambda expression
==============================

 -- Operator: lambda varlist expression
     Jacal has the ability to work with lambda expressions, via the
     command `lambda'. Furthermore, Jacal always converts user
     definitions of functions by any method into lambda expressions and
     converts the dummy variables of the function definition into
     symbols such as 1, 2, .... Jacal can manipulate lambda expressions
     by manipulating their function parts, as in `e14' below.  Jacal can
     also invert a function using the command `finv'.

          e12 : lambda([x],x^2);

                              2
          e12: lambda([@1], @1 )

          e13 : lambda([x,y,z],x*y*z);

          e13: lambda([@1, @2, @3], @1 @2 @3)

          e14 : e12+e13;

                                      2
          e14: lambda([@1, @2, @3], @1  + @1 @2 @3)

5.2 Compute inverse function
============================

 -- Command: finv function
     `FUNCTION^^-1'

     The command `finv' takes as input a function of one variable and
     returns the inverse of that function. The function may be defined
     in any of the ways permitted in Jacal, i.e. by an explicit
     algebraic definition, by an explicit lambda expression or by an
     implicit lamba expression. If F is the function, then typing
     `f^^-1' has the same effect as typing `finv(F)'.

          e0 : w(t):=t+1;

          w(t): lambda([@1], 1 + @1)

          e0 : finv(w);

          e0: lambda([@1], -1 + @1)

6 Miscellaneous
***************

 -- Command: %
     The symbol `%' represents the last expression obtained by Jacal. It
     can be used in formulas like any other constant or variable or
     expression.

          e21: 5

          e22 : %;

          e22: 5

          e23 : %^2;

          e23: 25

 -- Command: batch filename
     The command `batch' is used to read in a file containing programs
     written in Jacal. Here, FILENAME is a string in double quotes. The
     precise way in which one refers to a file is, of course, system
     dependent.

          batch("demo");
     of the file demo in the JACAL directory will give a
     demonstration of JACAL's capabilities.

 -- Command: commands
     The command `commands' produces a list of all of the command
     available in Jacal. It is called as s function of no arguments.
     Explicitly:

          e21 : commands();

               describe denom crossproduct content commands col coeffs
               coeff bunch batch b+/- ^^ ^ = / - + * %

 -- Command: describe command
     The command `describe' is the heart of the online help facility of
     Jacal.  Here, COMMAND is a string which is the name of a command
     and `describe' produces a brief description of the command and in
     many cases includes an example of its use. Together with the
     command `commands()', which prints a list of all available Jacal
     commands, and the command `example', which gives an example of the
     use of the command, one can in principle use Jacal without a
     manual after one has learned how to get started.

          e27 : describe(col);
          column.  column of a matrix
          e27 : describe(resultant);
          resultant.  The result of eliminating a variable between 2
          equations (or polynomials).
          27 : describe(+);
          Addition, plus.
          a + b

 -- Command: example command
     Here, COMMAND is a string which is the name of a Jacal command.
     `example' gives an example of the use of the command.  See also
     *Note describe: Miscellaneous.

          e43 : example(+);
          a + b

          e43: a + b

 -- Command: load string
     The Jacal command `load' takes as input a string and reads in a
     `Scheme' file whose name is obtained by appending the extension
     `.scm' to the string.  If you want to read in a file of Jacal
     commands, do not use `load'.  Instead use the command `batch'. To
     load in the file `foo.scm',

          e9 : load("foo");

          e9: foo

 -- Command: qed
     Exit from Jacal to Scheme.  With interactive Scheme systems (such
     as SCM), It does not return you to the operating system.  Instead
     it suspends Jacal and returns you to the underlying scheme.  You
     can return to the Jacal session where you left off by simply
     typing `(math)'.  If you do not wish to return to Jacal but really
     want to terminate the session and return to the operating system,
     then after typing `qed();', type `(slib:exit)' or use `quit'.

 -- Command: quit
     Exit directly from Jacal to the operating system.  You will not be
     able to continue your Jacal session.

          type qed(); to return to scheme
          e1 : qed();
          scheme
          > (math)
          type qed(); to return to scheme
          e2 : quit();
          unix>

 -- Command: system command
     One can issue commands to the operating system without leaving
     Jacal. To do this, one uses the command `system'. For example, in
     a UNIX operating system, the command `system("ls");' will print the
     directory. One way in which the command `system' might be
     especially useful is to edit files containing Jacal scripts without
     leaving Jacal, particularly in non-UNIX machines or on machines
     without GNU emacs.

          e0 : system("echo hi there");
          hi there

          e0: 0

 -- Command: transcript string
     The command `transcript' allows one to record a Jacal session. It
     is called with the syntax `transcript(STRING);', where STRING is
     the name of the file in which one wants to keep the transcript of
     the session. When one wishes to stop recording, one types
     `transcript();'. One is then free to use `transcript' again later
     in the session on another file. One can use it on the same file,
     but the file is overwritten. Presently, the command `transcript'
     does not echo commands to a file.

          e9 : a:[1,2,3];

          e9: [1, 2, 3]

          e10 : transcript("foo");

 -- Command: set flag value
     There are various flags that the Jacal user can control, namely the
     Jacal command line prompt, the priority for printing terms in Jacal
     output, the input grammar and the output grammar.  For a
     discussion of the various grammars please *Note Flags::.  The
     command `show' is closely related, allowing one to see what the
     current settings are.

 -- Command: show flag
     The command `show' enables the Jacal user to examine the current
     setting of various flags as well as to list the flags that can be
     set by the user and to display other information. To change the
     settings of the flags, use the command `set'. To see all the

 -- Flag: prompt string
     If one changes the prompt, STRING is a string of alphanumeric
     characters without quotes.  After this command is executed,
     subsequent commands will cause new prompts to be obtained from
     STRING by incrementing it.  If the prompt ends in a letter, it
     will be treated as a digit in base 26 and incremented.  If it ends
     in a string of digits, that string will be treated as a number in
     base 10 and incremented.  The remaining characters in the string
     will play no role in this incrementation.

          e9 : e7;

          e9: [[3, 0], [0, 6]]

     Note that in the above examples, it is possible to input and output
     expressions in scheme by setting the ingrammar and/or outgrammar to
     `scheme'.  Doing so result in linear output (as with `standard
     grammar') as opposed to a two dimensional display (as with
     `disp2d').  The analogue of `disp2d' for scheme output is scheme
     pretty-printing.  To have such output, set the output grammar to
     `schemepretty'.


          e4 : set outgrammar schemepretty;
          e4 : (1+x)^5;

          (define e4
            (+ 1
               (* 5 x)
               (* 10 (^ x 2))
               (* 10 (^ x 3))
               (* 5 (^ x 4))
               (^ x 5)))

     Jacal also allows for output to be automatically typeset in TeX.
     This can be quite useful if one wants to use the results of one's
     computations in published articles. Continuing with the example of
     `(1+x)^5' above, we have:

          e5 : set outgrammar tex;
          e5 : e4;

          e5: 1 + 5 x + 10 x^{2} + 10 x^{3} + 5 x^{4} + x^{5}

          e6 : (1+1/x)^3/(1-1/y)^4;

          e6: {\left(1 + 3 x + 3 x^{2} + x^{3}\right) y^{4}}\over{x^{3} - 4 x^{3} y +

                          6 x^{3} y^{2} - 4 x^{3} y^{3} + x^{3} y^{4}}

     That looks much better when formatted by TeX in an article than the
     actual Jacal output in `disp2d' grammar.

 -- Flag: priority int
     The following examples show how to set the priority of printing
     terms.
          e10 : a;

          e10: [[[1, 2, 3]]]

          e11 : show priority a;

          ;;; not a simple variable:  (((1 2 3) . ()) . ())

          e12 : show priority b;

          e12: 128

          e13 : show priority c;

          e13: 128

          e14 : b+c;

          e14: b + c

          e15 : c+b;

          e15: b + c

          e16 : set priority b 200;
          e16 : b+c;

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other      |
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to        |
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,       |
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or                     |
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the            |
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not       |
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.           |
                                                                              |
     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative        |
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.         |
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft       |
     license designed for free software.                                      |
                                                                              |
     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for         |
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a         |
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms        |
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to              |
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless        |
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.          |
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is         |
     instruction or reference.                                                |
                                                                              |
  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS                                            |
                                                                              |
     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,         |
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it          |
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice       |
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,        |
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The                |
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member        |
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You             |
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a       |
     way requiring permission under copyright law.                            |
                                                                              |
     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the       |
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with             |
     modifications and/or translated into another language.                   |
                                                                              |
     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section      |
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the      |
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall          |
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could          |
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document       |
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not        |
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of         |
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or       |
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position       |
     regarding them.                                                          |
                                                                              |
     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose            |
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in          |
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this            |
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of              |
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.          |
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document       |
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.            |
                                                                              |
     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are            |
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice          |
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A           |
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may       |
     be at most 25 words.                                                     |
                                                                              |
     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,      |
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the          |
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document               |
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images               |
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some        |
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to       |
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of             |
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an        |
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of            |
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent             |
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is          |
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A           |
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".                       |
                                                                              |
     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain        |
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,          |
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and                          |
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for          |
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include       |
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that       |
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or      |
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally          |
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF             |
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.               |
                                                                              |
     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,       |
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the            |
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For         |
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title        |
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the           |
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.           |
                                                                              |
     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document           |
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses       |
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ       |
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as              |
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)        |
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the            |
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according        |
     to this definition.                                                      |
                                                                              |
     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice         |
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These           |
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in       |
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other      |
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and         |
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.                            |
                                                                              |
  2. VERBATIM COPYING                                                         |
                                                                              |
     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either           |
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the         |
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License            |
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you       |
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You        |
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading        |
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,       |
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you              |
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow          |
     the conditions in section 3.                                             |
                                                                              |
     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,        |
     and you may publicly display copies.                                     |
                                                                              |
  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY                                                      |
                                                                              |
     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly          |
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and       |
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must             |
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all        |
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and             |
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly       |
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The          |
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the            |
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material         |
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the          |
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and           |
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in          |
     other respects.                                                          |
                                                                              |
     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit         |
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit            |
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto              |
     adjacent pages.                                                          |
                                                                              |
     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document               |
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a                       |
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or        |
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from       |
     which the general network-using public has access to download            |
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent           |
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the            |
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you          |
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that          |
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated          |
     location until at least one year after the last time you                 |
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or            |
     retailers) of that edition to the public.                                |
                                                                              |
     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of       |
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of              |
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated             |
     version of the Document.                                                 |
                                                                              |
  4. MODIFICATIONS                                                            |
                                                                              |
     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document           |
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you        |
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with          |
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus              |
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to       |
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these          |
     things in the Modified Version:                                          |
                                                                              |
       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title           |
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of               |
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed       |
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the           |
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of       |
          that version gives permission.                                      |
                                                                              |
       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or          |
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in         |
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the            |
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal             |
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you        |
          from this requirement.                                              |
                                                                              |
       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the            |
          Modified Version, as the publisher.                                 |
                                                                              |
       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.                 |
                                                                              |
       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications          |
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.                            |
                                                                              |
       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license         |
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified             |
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in       |
          the Addendum below.                                                 |
                                                                              |
       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant         |
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's           |
          license notice.                                                     |
                                                                              |
       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.                          |
                                                                              |
       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,        |
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new         |
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on          |
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in       |
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,          |
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,           |
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in       |
          the previous sentence.                                              |
                                                                              |
       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document        |
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and        |
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for            |
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in          |
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a       |
          work that was published at least four years before the              |
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version        |
          it refers to gives permission.                                      |
                                                                              |
       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",       |
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the              |
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor       |
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.                  |
                                                                              |
       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,                |
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers       |
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section            |
          titles.                                                             |
                                                                              |
       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section         |
          may not be included in the Modified Version.                        |
                                                                              |
       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled                  |
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant           |
          Section.                                                            |
                                                                              |
       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.                                  |
                                                                              |
     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or            |
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no             |
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option                |
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,       |
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified       |
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any        |
     other section titles.                                                    |
                                                                              |
     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains      |
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various             |
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text         |
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative                |
     definition of a standard.                                                |
                                                                              |
     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,         |
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end         |
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one            |
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be            |
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the       |
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,               |
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity        |
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may        |
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous            |
     publisher that added the old one.                                        |
                                                                              |
     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this            |
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to       |
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.                     |
                                                                              |
  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS                                                      |
                                                                              |
     You may combine the Document with other documents released under         |
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for             |
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination          |
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,          |
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your              |
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all           |
     their Warranty Disclaimers.                                              |
                                                                              |
     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and        |
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single      |
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name       |
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique       |
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the              |
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a         |
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in        |
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the              |
     combined work.                                                           |
                                                                              |
     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled               |
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section         |
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled               |
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You        |
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."                        |
                                                                              |
  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS                                                 |
                                                                              |
     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other           |
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual        |
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy       |
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the         |
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the                |
     documents in all other respects.                                         |
                                                                              |
     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and            |
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert       |
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow           |
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of         |
     that document.                                                           |
                                                                              |
  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS                                       |
                                                                              |
     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other              |
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of        |
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the        |
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the        |
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual       |
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this       |
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which         |
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.                     |
                                                                              |
     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these        |
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half       |
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed        |
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the         |
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic         |
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket         |
     the whole aggregate.                                                     |

  8. TRANSLATION                                                              |
                                                                              |
     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may             |
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section       |
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special      |
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include             |
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the        |
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a        |
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the          |
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also           |
     include the original English version of this License and the             |
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a        |
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of         |
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will        |
     prevail.                                                                 |

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",             |
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to              |
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the       |
     actual title.                                                            |
                                                                              |

     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is        |
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this            |
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,          |
     from you under this License will not have their licenses                 |
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.            |
                                                                              |
 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE                                         |
                                                                              |
     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of        |
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new          |
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may       |
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See               |
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.                                          |

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version            |
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered            |
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you        |
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of          |
     that specified version or of any later version that has been             |
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If          |
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,          |
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the        |
     Free Software Foundation.                                                |
                                                                              |

A.2 How to use this License for your documents                                |
==============================================                                |
                                                                              |
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of         |
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license       |
notices just after the title page:                                            |
                                                                              |
       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.                                        |
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document  |
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2     |
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;        |
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover    |
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.                                          |
                                                                              |
  If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover            |
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:                            |
                                                                              |
         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with            |
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts      |
         being LIST.                                                          |
                                                                              |
  If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other           |
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the            |
situation.                                                                    |
                                                                              |
  If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we           |
